ooh - look at that ...

# Update for the Nabaztag Bunny rebuild
## This time with Pi

A bit of background...

One night - back when i used to get the tram into work, i got drunk at the pub and somewhere around Pamona I decided to buy a Nabaztag on eBay.  I'd always wanted on and what the hell, I needed a bunny.

When it arrived I realised why this was now a rare commodity - the network connectivity was insecure and so i could no longer safely attach it to a network.

So it got put under the spare bed, but i didn't stop thinking about it.

Last year I managed (with my husbands help (he did the wiring and soldering for the HBridge)) to get the basics of movement and light back on the rabbit using an Arduino.
Life was good for a while.  I got the bunny to monitor slack and behave differently when the number of negative slack emojies became critical.

But this was not enough.

The Bunny (for now it had earned a captial B) was awesome and working, but not independant.  It needed to be plugged into my machine. And that was a limitation.
So I asked for a Raspberry Pi for my birthday, and i got it, and it was good.  And then i ran out of time and the Bunny, now back in bits, was once again consined to it's box, only this time on show in my living room. 

And then i went to Nodeconf 2017 and i was given the most awesome, Open Source, hackable, conference badge. https://www.nearform.com/blog/say-hello-to-the-nodeconf-eu-hackable-badge/ and I remembered how much i love IoT and how much my soldering skill suck.

I've been working on the Bunny since then.  It is slow going but i am achieving.  I am using
