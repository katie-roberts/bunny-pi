ooh - look at that ...

# Update for the Nabaztag Bunny rebuild
## This time with Pi

### A bit of background...

One night - back when I used to get the tram into work, I got drunk at the pub and, on a tram somewhere around Pamona, I decided to buy a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabaztag">Nabaztag</a> on eBay.  I'd always wanted one, and what the hell, I needed a bunny.

When it arrived I realised why this was now a rare commodity - the network connectivity was insecure and so I could no longer safely attach it to a network.

So it got put under the spare bed, but i didn't stop thinking about it.

Last year I managed (with my husbands help (he did the wiring and soldering for the HBridge)) to get the basics of movement and lights back on the rabbit using an Arduino.
Life was good for a while.  I got the bunny to monitor slack and behave differently when the number of negative slack emojies being used by my team became critical.

But this was not enough.

The Bunny (for now it had earned a capital B) was awesome and working, but not independent.  It needed to be plugged into my machine. And that was a limitation.

So I asked for a Raspberry Pi for my birthday, and I got one, and it was good.  And then I ran out of time and the Bunny, now back in bits, was once again consined to it's box, only this time on show in my living room.

And then I went to Nodeconf 2017 and i was given the most awesome, Open Source, hackable, <a href="https://www.nearform.com/blog/say-hello-to-the-nodeconf-eu-hackable-badge/">conference badge</a> and I remembered how much I love IoT, and how much my soldering skill suck.

## Onto the build

I've been working on the Bunny since then.  It is slow going but i am achieving.  I am using
* Raspberry Pi 2
* Adifruit Hat
* Johnnie 5

I have also done a soldering practice kit (something like this https://www.maplin.co.uk/p/velleman-led-running-lights-solder-kit-vx96e) and listened to my husband when he trys to teach me to not use too much solder and "let it flow".

## Progress and Update

So far the Bunny has the following capabilities
- ear moving
- light lighting
- button pressing

as well as inbuilt pi capabilites from the USB camera and audio output that i have wired into the Nabaztag's original speaker.

Sad things - the slack integration is taking longer because <a href= "api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens">things have changed</a>. But i can change too!  and i will!
